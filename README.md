# OpenREST: An Opinionated REST Contract

## Introduction

OpenREST is a strongly opinionated contract for RESTful APIs that is designed to be simple, easy to understand,
and easy to implement. We created it because your organization has bigger problems to solve than arguing about
how to structure these things.

## Project Structure

This project is a hugo docsy site, manually deployed to GitHub Pages. The site is available at
[https://openrest.krotscheck.net/](https://rest.krotscheck.net/), and the source code is available at
[https://github.com/krotscheck/openrest](https://github.com/krotscheck/o-rest).

## Tools

We do not yet have a toolkit that assists in linting, vetting, or valiating an API against this contract. If you're
interested in building one, please reach out to me.

## License

This project is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License. To view a
copy of the license,
visit [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/).

I chose this license for two reasons. First, it lets organizations modify it for their own internal use. However,
it does not permit republishing of such work, which may dilute the original intent of the contract. If an organization
wishes to claim adherence to this contract, they should link back to the original source.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please either raise an issue or submit a pull request. If you're submitting a pull request,
please ensure that you've run the `make` command to ensure that the site builds correctly. Fair warning, I like to argue
about these things, so be ready for a video call where we go into detail.
