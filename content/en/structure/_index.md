title: Core API Structure
weight: 1
---

This section covers common structural elements, aiming to be the organizational foundation of your RESTful
API. It ensures that your project cleanly separates resources and their contexts and offers explicit rules for paths,
actions, and errors. This structure is designed to be simple, easy to understand, and easy to implement.

A clear and consistent structure brings numerous benefits. It ensures that all APIs follow the same design
principles, making them easier to understand and use. Scalability is achieved by maintaining consistent foundational
elements, allowing for the seamless addition of new features and services. Standardized patterns for paths, actions, and
errors simplify maintenance and updates, reducing bugs and inconsistencies, which enhances maintainability. Improved
collaboration among developers is facilitated by clear structure and guidelines, reducing onboarding and code review
time. Additionally, a consistent and well-structured API improves ease of interaction, leading to enhanced user
satisfaction.

Or, in plain talk: If everything follows the same rules, you can implement it once it in a shared library and
move on to worrying about your business logic instead.
